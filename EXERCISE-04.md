## <a id="exercise4"></a>Exercise 4 - Configure the Windows Target/Staging Server

In this exercise, you will:

  * Download the Delphix Connector
  * Install the Delphix Connector
  * Enable Powershell scripts on the target

Before we start this exercise is important to mention that in Delphix, a
Target and Staging server have the same configuration. It's a Delphix best
practice to isolate the Staging workload from the VDB workload, so that's why
it has a different name, but from a requirements point of view, they
are the same.

2. Double click "Windows Target" to connect to the Windows Target server
